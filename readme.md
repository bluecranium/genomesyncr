## Goals
* Download and sync table flatfiles from UCSC's FTP
* Keep UCSC's folder structure: A partial local mirror of the tables you need
* Provide some faculty for parsing the tables based on their schemas and creating GenomicRanges objects from them
* Provide some common joins on KnownGene to add gene symbol, cytoBand, etc (may be duplicating GenomicFeatures)

## Usage
In development.
